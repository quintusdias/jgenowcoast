WEATHER SUMMARY
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE PADUCAH KY
333 AM CDT MON JUL 27 2015

A COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS HELD TOGETHER AS IT PUSHED SOUTHEAST 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE QUAD STATE REGION ON SUNDAY. THE RAIN AND CLOUDS 
HELPED TO KEEP TEMPERATURES ABOUT 5 DEGREES LOWER THAN SATURDAYS 
READINGS. HIGHS WERE GENERALLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S. WARM AND 
MUGGY CONDITIONS PREVAILED INTO SUNDAY NIGHT AS MORE SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY MOVED INTO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. 
EARLY THIS MONDAY MORNING...TEMPERATURES RANGED FROM THE LOWER TO 
MID 70S WITH LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS. 

HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS AN UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS ANCHORED OVER THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES. SMALL 
CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS ARE DIFFICULT TO RULE OUT THROUGH THE 
PERIOD AS WEAK POCKETS OF ENERGY ROTATE AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE. HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE FORECAST TO TOP 90 DEGREES 
TODAY...THEN THE LOWER TO MID 90S TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN PEAK HEAT INDICES OF AT LEAST 100 TO 105 DEGREES AND 
LOCALLY HIGHER EACH AFTERNOON.

THANKFULLY...SOME RELIEF FROM THE HEAT IS ON THE WAY LATER IN THE 
WEEK. A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE APPROACH OF THIS FRONT WILL 
BRING A BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON WEDNESDAY. 
BEHIND THE FRONT...MILDER AND MUCH DRIER AIR WILL TAKE HOLD AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA. IN FACT...HIGHS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY 
ARE FORECAST TO REACH ONLY THE MID TO UPPER 80S.
