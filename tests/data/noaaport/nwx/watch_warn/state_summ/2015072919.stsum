REGIONAL WEATHER SUMMARY
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE JACKSON KY
304 PM EDT WED JUL 29 2015

EASTERN KENTUCKY WAS UNDER PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THIS

TOTALS VARIED FROM A TRACE TO 2.04 INCHES. THE HIGHER RAINFALL
TOTALS GENERALLY OCCURRED IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE REGION.

EXPERIENCING A HOT...HUMID AFTERNOON. UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY
SKIES...TEMPERATURES CLIMBED INTO THE UPPER 80S...WITH HIGH
DEWPOINTS MAKING IT FEEL MORE LIKE THE MID 90S. TYPICAL HIGHS FOR

PULASKI COUNTY...A MOBILE HOME WAS OVERTURNED AND A PORCH WAS
