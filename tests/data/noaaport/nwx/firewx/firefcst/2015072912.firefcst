FIRE WEATHER PLANNING FORECAST FOR NORTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE GAYLORD MI
839 AM EDT WED JUL 29 2015

...LATE DAY ELEVATED FIRE DANGER AND THURSDAY AFTERNOON...

.DISCUSSION...

FOR TODAY...
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP ALONG A COLD FRONT THAT WILL
CROSS THE REGION TODAY. CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS ALSO INCREASE
AND WILL BECOME MORE LIKELY IN NORTHEAST LOWER THIS AFTERNOON
FOR THE BEST WETTING POTENTIAL. THIS WILL LIKELY LOWER THE FIRE
DANGER THERE. NO SEVERE WEATHER EXPECTED. STILL LOOKING AT DEEPER
DRIER AIR AND INCREASING WINDS TO DEVELOP THROUGH THE DAY FROM 
WEST TO EAST...BUT THIS PROCESS IS SLOWER NOW. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
PERSISTENT DRY CONDITIONS...WARM TEMPERATURES AND GUSTY WINDS WILL
RESULT IN ELEVATED FIRE DANGER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND AGAIN
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. A COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH
MICHIGAN TODAY...BUT PRECIPITATION FROM THIS FRONT WILL BE SCATTERED
AND LIMITED. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK INTO THE REGION TONIGHT
INTO THURSDAY IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY
BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER ON THURSDAY...STILL WARMING INTO THE LOW TO
MID 80S.

839 AM EDT WED JUL 29 2015

...LATE DAY ELEVATED FIRE DANGER AND THURSDAY AFTERNOON...

.DISCUSSION...

FOR TODAY...
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP ALONG A COLD FRONT THAT WILL
CROSS THE REGION TODAY. CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS ALSO INCREASE
AND WILL BECOME MORE LIKELY IN NORTHEAST LOWER THIS AFTERNOON
FOR THE BEST WETTING POTENTIAL. THIS WILL LIKELY LOWER THE FIRE
DANGER THERE. NO SEVERE WEATHER EXPECTED. STILL LOOKING AT DEEPER
DRIER AIR AND INCREASING WINDS TO DEVELOP THROUGH THE DAY FROM 
WEST TO EAST...BUT THIS PROCESS IS SLOWER NOW. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
PERSISTENT DRY CONDITIONS...WARM TEMPERATURES AND GUSTY WINDS WILL
RESULT IN ELEVATED FIRE DANGER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND AGAIN
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. A COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH
MICHIGAN TODAY...BUT PRECIPITATION FROM THIS FRONT WILL BE SCATTERED
AND LIMITED. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK INTO THE REGION TONIGHT
INTO THURSDAY IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY
BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER ON THURSDAY...STILL WARMING INTO THE LOW TO
MID 80S.
