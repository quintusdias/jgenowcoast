    - A TROPICAL STORM WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR INLAND 
      BERKELEY...CHARLESTON AND TIDAL BERKELEY

* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:
    - A TROPICAL STORM WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR INLAND 
      BERKELEY...CHARLESTON AND TIDAL BERKELEY

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

SUBTROPICAL STORM ANA WILL MOVE GRADUALLY NORTHWESTWARD TOWARD THE 
NORTHERN PORTION OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
BEFORE WEAKENING TO A DEPRESSION AS IT MAKES LANDFALL ON SUNDAY. 

THE MAIN IMPACT IS EXPECTED TO BE ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COAST OF 
CHARLESTON COUNTY...WHERE HIGH SEAS...SOME BEACH EROSION...AND 
DANGEROUS RIP CURRENTS ARE EXPECTED. BREAKING WAVES OF 4 TO 6 FEET 
WILL OCCUR ALONG THE CHARLESTON COUNTY BEACHES AND WILL RESULT IN 
HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS IN THE SURF ZONE. POCKETS OF BEACH EROSION ARE 
ALSO LIKELY TO OCCUR... ESPECIALLY ALONG EAST AND NORTHEAST FACING 
BEACHES. SOME MINOR COASTAL FLOODING IS ALSO POSSIBLE AT THE TIMES 
OF HIGH TIDE LATE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY EVENINGS IN CHARLESTON AND 
BERKELEY COUNTIES...BUT SIGNIFICANT FLOODING OF STRUCTURES ALONG THE 
COAST OR THE INLAND WATERWAYS IS NOT EXPECTED AT THIS TIME.

THE RISK FOR LONG-DURATION TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS WILL GENERALLY 
REMAIN CONFINED TO THE COASTAL WATERS OF CHARLESTON COUNTY. THE RISK 
FOR TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS OVER LAND WILL MAINLY OCCUR FRIDAY 
AND SATURDAY AFTERNOONS AS THE CENTER OF ANA GETS CLOSER TO THE 
COAST. WINDS OF THIS MAGNITUDE ARE CAPABLE OF DOWNING A FEW TREES 
AND POWERLINES. SOME POWER OUTAGES ARE POSSIBLE.

FOR THE COASTLINE SOUTH OF EDISTO BEACH DOWN TO THE MOUTH OF THE 
ALTAMAHA RIVER IN GEORGIA...THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A HIGH RISK OF 
RIP CURRENTS THROUGH FRIDAY.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* WIND:
PREPARE FOR HAZARDOUS WIND HAVING POSSIBLE LIMITED IMPACTS ACROSS 
CHARLESTON AND BERKELEY COUNTIES. POTENTIAL IMPACTS IN THIS AREA INCLUDE:

      MOBILE HOMES. UNSECURED LIGHTWEIGHT OBJECTS BLOWN ABOUT.
    - SOME LARGE TREE LIMBS BROKEN OFF. A FEW TREES SNAPPED OR 
      UPROOTED IN PLACES WHERE TREES ARE SHALLOW ROOTED. SOME FENCES AND 
      ROADWAY SIGNS POSSIBLY BLOWN OVER.

      OR HEAVILY WOODED PLACES. HAZARDOUS DRIVING CONDITIONS ON 
      BRIDGES AND OTHER ELEVATED ROADWAYS.
    - SCATTERED POWER AND COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES.

ELSEWHERE ACROSS SOUTHEAST SOUTH CAROLINA AND SOUTHEAST GEORGIA, 
LITTLE TO NO IMPACT IS ANTICIPATED.

* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:

HIGH SEAS...SOME BEACH EROSION...AND DANGEROUS RIP CURRENTS ARE 
EXPECTED ALONG THE CHARLESTON COUNTY COAST. BREAKING WAVES OF 4 TO 
6 FEET WILL OCCUR ALONG THE CHARLESTON COUNTY BEACHES AND WILL 
RESULT IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS IN THE SURF ZONE. POCKETS OF BEACH 
EROSION ARE ALSO LIKELY TO OCCUR... ESPECIALLY ALONG EAST AND 
NORTHEAST FACING BEACHES.

* SURGE:
PREPARE FOR LOCALLY HAZARDOUS SURGE HAVING POSSIBLE LIMITED IMPACTS 
ACROSS CHARLESTON AND BERKELEY COUNTIES. POTENTIAL IMPACTS IN THIS AREA 
INCLUDE:
    - LOCALIZED INUNDATION WITH STORM SURGE FLOODING MAINLY ALONG 
      IMMEDIATE SHORELINES AND IN LOW-LYING SPOTS, OR IN AREAS 
      FARTHER INLAND NEAR WHERE HIGHER SURGE WATERS MOVE ASHORE.
    - SECTIONS OF NEAR-SHORE ROADS AND PARKING LOTS BECOME OVERSPREAD 
      WITH SURGE WATER. DRIVING CONDITIONS DANGEROUS IN PLACES WHERE 
      SURGE WATER COVERS THE ROAD.

      AND PIERS. A FEW SMALL CRAFT BROKEN AWAY FROM MOORINGS.
