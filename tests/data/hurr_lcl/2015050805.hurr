        - PEAK WIND FORECAST: 20-30 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 45 MPH

    - CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: ELEVATED
        - THE WIND THREAT HAS REMAINED NEARLY STEADY FROM THE 
          PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT.
        - EMERGENCY CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD INCLUDE A REASONABLE THREAT 
          FOR TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND OF 39 TO 57 MPH.
        - BE SAFE AND PROTECT AGAINST THE POTENTIAL OF LIMITED WIND 
          IMPACTS.
        - HAZARDOUS WIND IS POSSIBLE. FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY SHELTER 
          MAY RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: LIMITED
        - IF REALIZED, TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO 
          PORCHES, AWNINGS, CARPORTS, SHEDS, AND UNANCHORED MOBILE 
          HOMES. UNSECURED LIGHTWEIGHT OBJECTS BLOWN ABOUT.
        - MANY LARGE TREE LIMBS BROKEN OFF. A FEW TREES SNAPPED OR 
          UPROOTED, BUT WITH GREATER NUMBERS IN PLACES WHERE TREES

          OVER.
        - A FEW ROADS IMPASSABLE FROM DEBRIS, PARTICULARLY WITHIN 
          URBAN OR HEAVILY WOODED PLACES. HAZARDOUS DRIVING 
          CONDITIONS ON BRIDGES AND OTHER ELEVATED ROADWAYS.
        - SCATTERED POWER AND COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES.

* FLOODING RAIN
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: FLOOD WATCH IS IN EFFECT
        - PEAK RAINFALL AMOUNTS: ADDITIONAL AROUND 1 INCH

    - CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: ELEVATED
        - THE FLOODING RAIN THREAT HAS REMAINED NEARLY STEADY FROM 
          THE PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT.
        - EMERGENCY CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD INCLUDE A THREAT OF 
          FLOODING.
        - BE SAFE AND REMAIN READY TO PROTECT AGAINST FLOODING RAIN 
          IMPACTS. STAY INFORMED.
        - IF FLOOD RELATED WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE IN EFFECT, HEED

          WARNINGS FOR LONGER-TERM IMPACTS ALONG RIVERS.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: LIMITED
        - IF REALIZED, LOCALIZED RAINFALL FLOODING MAY PROMPT A FEW 
          EVACUATIONS.
        - RIVERS AND TRIBUTARIES MAY QUICKLY RISE WITH SWIFTER 
          CURRENTS. SMALL STREAMS, CREEKS, CANALS, ARROYOS, AND 
          DITCHES MAY BECOME SWOLLEN AND OVERFLOW IN SPOTS.
        - FLOOD WATERS CAN ENTER A FEW STRUCTURES, ESPECIALLY IN 
          USUALLY VULNERABLE SPOTS. A FEW PLACES WHERE RAPID PONDING 
          OF WATER OCCURS AT UNDERPASSES, LOW-LYING SPOTS, AND POOR 
          DRAINAGE AREAS. SEVERAL STORM DRAINS AND RETENTION PONDS 
          BECOME NEAR-FULL AND BEGIN TO OVERFLOW. SOME BRIEF ROAD AND 
          BRIDGE CLOSURES.
